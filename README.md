                                            Trip-Mate: Effortless Trip Management & Expense Tracking
The Problem:

    Imagine planning a team trip or a spontaneous trip with friends. The excitement is palpable! But then comes the inevitable: coordinating expenses. Who paid for lunch? How much does everyone owe for the rental car? Splitting costs for activities? The chaos of manual tracking on spreadsheets or scattered notes quickly dampens the spirit of the trip.

Story:

    Just this past June, I experienced this firsthand. Our team had a reconnect at Bangalore office, At the end of which me with my two colleagues vatsal and rajat planned trip to Pondicherry. We had a blast, but managing the finances was a nightmare. We had numerous expenses: lunches, scooter rentals, dinners, water sports etc.– each with its own unique payment and splitting scenario.

    For example:

    Day 1 Lunch (1 PM): Total ₹1200, paid ₹1000 by Rajat and ₹200 by Vatsal. To be split between me, Vatsal, and Rajat.
    Coffee (4 PM): Total ₹800, paid by me, split between the three of us.
    Water Sports: Total ₹3000, paid by Rajat, split only between me and Rajat as Vatsal opted out.
    I resorted to a spreadsheet, which was cumbersome and prone to errors. It was clear: there had to be a better way.
